"My  years worth  thousands of comments Considering deleting my account wanted to know if its possible to back everything up I have some good stuff I wanted to save and some good comments from others 

For perspective I havent programmed a whole lot but I know my way around a computer enough to get in trouble  just wanted to know if theres any extra software I need to be able to run this script then really think long and hard about where I spend my time these days

Thanks for your help my dude",1,5,en,#General,Respectful
Late to the party but like everyone else said so far Monte Carlo is going to give you a better probability distribution of conditional win  lose than attempting to build a model to do the same using a dataset of actual games outcomes hands dealt are random However if youre instead perhaps supplementing probability of a particular hand winning trying to model the likelihood of an opposing players actions fold hold bet then such a dataset might be useful but will be highly dependent on the risk appetite of the individual players in the data and the resulting model will probably be specific to those players if its data from professional players then you can probably generalize it for a model that has consistent performance across games with different players but would want to test between professional and nonprofessional to see if behavior is significantly different,2,1,en,#AI,Formal

I had a similar project We collected celebrity heights and weights and ran each celebrity name through a google image scraper along with search terms like red carpet Then we filtered them with pose detection to ensure all limbs were visible Of course the clothing can be a bit skewed if you only search for red carpet but you get the idea We also ran measures scraped and pixel measurements from the photos with the ANSUR II dataset to guesstimate other anthropometrical measurements with varying levels of success Edit this sort of thing is useful for pixel measurement btw,2,1,en,#General,Formal

"Yes I fully understand the issues with building a Twitter collection to the point where I spent several months creating a large collection of Twitter data I published about it recently at ACM CIKM 

The API does not only give you access to a couple of weeks of data if you are willing to wait for it The streaming API gives you access to  of Tweets posted in a real time or  if you have been granted elevated access 

You are correct that Twitter are not going to go after those downloading it they are going to go after those who created and distributed it That is why most datasets require that an agreement is signed before they will even grant access to Tweet IDs  The fact is the people who create these datasets and who have access to them have agreed not to distribute them and as they are mostly big businesses or academic institutes they are not going to break ethical guidelines and risk their job so that someone else can cut some corners to get Twitter data

What exactly do you want the dataset for Youre not going to find months worth of Twitter data for download anywhere its simply a huge volume of data event if its only a  sample If you are at a University make a request around your computer science department it is likely that someone there has been downloading Twitter data",1,7,en,"#AI, #Career",Formal
